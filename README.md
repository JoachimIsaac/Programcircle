# Programcircle

Description: This program accepts the value of the radius and degrees from the user
             then it calculates these values to get the degrees converted into radians,
             the arc length of the angle within the circle and the area of the angle
             within the circle. After the calculations have been made it prints out these
             values for the user.

Installation: Download the .cpp file and run it on a compiler that runs c++. This website(https://repl.it/) (copy and paste it the link and go to the website)could also be use to run this project. After that, copy and paste the .cpp file into repl.it and run it. The terminal could also be use to run the file. for terminal use (1) g++ and the file name; (2) on mac ./a.out to run and on windows ./a.exe

Usage: When this program runs you have to input the first number which would be your radius (it can be in point value like 5.5). Then you press enter and then input the amount of degrees that your angle within your circle has (it can also be in point value). Once you type it in and hit enter then the out put of  the degrees converted into radians,the arc length of the angle within the circle and the area of the angle within the circle will be printed out.


Reason for creating: Thought it was a great idea since I was learning about this in math class. It helps with cross checking home work and it will get different convertions ahead of time. Example: if i'm looking for the degrees to be converted into radians, the math question may some times follow up with , what is the arc length, but the program already calculates it. 


Improvements: Looking to get this program to be more complex, to be able to do sin, cos , tan calculations and have a graphical user interface.
